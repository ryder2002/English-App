# **App Name**: LinguaLeap

## Core Features:

- Vocabulary Creation: Allow users to manually add English and Chinese vocabulary words.
- Automatic IPA and Pinyin Generation: Automatically generate IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) for English words and Pinyin for Chinese words when a user inputs a new vocabulary word. It can also automatically translate from English/Chinese to Vietnamese.
- Flashcard Learning: Enable users to practice vocabulary using a flashcard-style interface. Show either the English/Chinese word or the IPA/Pinyin/Vietnamese translation first.
- Dictionary Tab: A tab for dictionary searches to provide additional information about the word in question. Displays IPA or Pinyin as needed.
- AI Chatbot: Integrate an AI chatbot (Gemini API) to answer user questions related to language learning. The chatbot is a tool that can provide translations, definitions, example sentences and grammar tips, reasoning about when such details are appropriate.

## Style Guidelines:
